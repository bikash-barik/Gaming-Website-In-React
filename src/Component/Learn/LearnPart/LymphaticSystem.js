Some 20 liters of plasma flow through your body’s arteries and smaller arteriole blood vessels and capillaries every day. The lymphatic system collects this excess fluid, now called lymph, from tissues in your body and moves it along until it's ultimately returned to your bloodstream."

            "Cervical lymph nodes are located in the sides and back of the neck. These glands are usually very small. However, when a lymph node is greater than 1 centimeter in diameter, it is enlarged. The cervical lymph nodes sit deep inside the neck. Cervical lymph nodes, like the rest of the body’s lymph nodes, are responsible for fighting infection."

        title={"A lymph duct is a great lymphatic vessel that empties lymph into one of the subclavian veins. There are two lymph ducts in the body—the right lymphatic duct and the thoracic duct. The right lymphatic duct drains lymph from the right upper limb, right side of thorax and right halves of head and neck. The thoracic duct drains lymph into the circulatory system at the left brachiocephalic vein between the left subclavian and left internal jugular veins."} />

        heading={"3.Cisterna Chyli:-"} 
        title={"The cisterna chyli is the abdominal origin of the thoracic duct, and it receives the bilateral lumbar lymphatic trunks. It is located in the retrocrural space, to the right side and behind of the abdominal aorta.In adults, the thoracic duct varies in length from 38 to 45 cm."} />

        imgcont={"../images/ms.png"} 
        heading={"4. Lumber Lymph Nodes:-"} 
        title={"Lumbar lymph nodes refer to a group of small organs that are part of the immune system. Lymph nodes are generally circular, bean-like organs that are dispersed throughout the body. The lumbar lymph nodes are located in the region of the body between the diaphragm and pelvis, known as the lumbar region. They are also called the lateral aortic lymph nodes. The nodes are part of the lymphatic system of the human body."} />

        imgcont={"../images/ms.png"} 
        heading={"5.Pelvic Lymph Node:-"} 
        title={"A lymph node in the pelvis. The pelvis is the area of the body below the abdomen that contains the hip bones, bladder, rectum, and male or female reproductive organs. Pelvic lymph nodes drain and filter lymph from the pelvis and nearby areas. A pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) is surgery to remove the lymph nodes from the pelvis. A PLND is also called a pelvic lymphadenectomy, ilioinguinal lymphadenectomy or deep groin dissection."} />

        heading={"6.Tonsils:-"} 
        title={"Tonsils are the two lymph nodes located on each side of the back of your throat. They function as a defense mechanism and help prevent your body from getting an infection. When tonsils become infected, the condition is called tonsillitis. Tonsillitis can occur at any age and is a common childhood illness."} />

        heading={"7.Thoracic Duct:-"} 
        title={"The thoracic duct is the main lymphatic vessel for the return of chyle/lymph to the systemic venous system. It drains lymph from both lower limbs, abdomen, left hemithorax, left upper limb and left face and neck. The thoracic duct usually starts from the level of the twelfth thoracic vertebrae and extends to the root of the neck."} />

        heading={"8.Axillary Lymph Nodes:-"} 
        title={"The axillary lymph nodes, also known commonly as axillary nodes, are a group of lymph nodes in the axilla and receive lymph from vessels that drain the arm, the walls of the thorax, the breast and the upper walls of the abdomen. The body has about 20 to 40 bean-shaped axillary lymph nodes located in the underarm area."} />

        heading={"9. Peyer’s Patches:-"} 
        title={"These are small masses of lymphatic tissue in the mucous membrane that lines your small intestine. These lymphoid cells monitor and destroy bacteria in the intestines. Also known as aggregated lymphoid nodules, they form an important part of the immune system by monitoring intestinal bacteria populations and preventing the growth of pathogenic bacteria in the intestine."} />

        heading={"10. Lymph Vessels:-"}

        title={"Inguinal lymph nodes are lymph nodes in the human groin. Located in the femoral triangle of the inguinal region, they are grouped into superficial and deep lymph nodes. The superficial have three divisions: the superomedial, superolateral, and inferior superficial. They are the superficial inguinal lymph nodes and the deep inguinal lymph nodes."} />

        title={"A small bean-shaped structure that is part of the body’s immune system. Lymph nodes filter substances that travel through the lymphatic fluid, and they contain lymphocytes (white blood cells) that help the body fight infection and disease. There are hundreds of lymph nodes found throughout the body. They are connected to one another by lymph vessels. Clusters of lymph nodes are found in the neck, axilla (underarm), chest, abdomen, and groin."}
