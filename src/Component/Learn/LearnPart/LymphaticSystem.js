Some 20 liters of plasma flow through your body’s arteries and smaller arteriole blood vessels and capillaries every day. The lymphatic system collects this excess fluid, now called lymph, from tissues in your body and moves it along until it's ultimately returned to your bloodstream."

Cervical lymph nodes, like the rest of the body’s lymph nodes, are responsible for fighting infection."

The thoracic duct drains lymph into the circulatory system at the left brachiocephalic vein between the left subclavian and left internal jugular veins."} />

A PLND is also called a pelvic lymphadenectomy, ilioinguinal lymphadenectomy or deep groin dissection."} />
