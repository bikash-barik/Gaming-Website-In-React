              "The human ear, like that of other mammals, contains sense organs that serve two quite different functions: that of hearing and that of postural equilibrium and coordination of head and eye movements. Anatomically, the ear has three distinguishable parts: the outer, middle, and inner ear. The outer ear consists of the visible portion called the auricle, or pinna, which projects from the side of the head, and the short external auditory canal, the inner end of which is closed by the tympanic membrane, commonly called the eardrum. The function of the outer ear is to collect sound waves and guide them to the tympanic membrane. The middle ear is a narrow air-filled cavity in the temporal bone. It is spanned by a chain of three tiny bones—the malleus (hammer), incus (anvil), and stapes (stirrup), collectively called the auditory ossicles. This ossicular chain conducts sound from the tympanic membrane to the inner ear, which has been known since the time of Galen (2nd century CE) as the labyrinth. It is a complicated system of fluid-filled passages and cavities located deep within the rock-hard petrous portion of the temporal bone. The inner ear consists of two functional units: the vestibular apparatus, consisting of the vestibule and semicircular canals, which contains the sensory organs of postural equilibrium; and the snail-shell-like cochlea, which contains the sensory organ of hearing. These sensory organs are highly specialized endings of the eighth cranial nerve, also called the vestibulocochlear nerve."

        heading={"Tympanic Membrane"} 
        title={"The tympanic membrane is also called the eardrum. It separates the outer ear from the middle ear. When sound waves reach the tympanic membrane they cause it to vibrate. The vibrations are then transferred to the tiny bones in the middle ear. The middle ear bones then transfer the vibrating signals to the inner ear. The tympanic membrane is made up of a thin connective tissue membrane covered by skin on the outside and mucosa on the internal surface."} />
        <MuscularSystem 
        heading={"Malleus:-"} 
        title={"The malleus, also known as the “hammer” or “mallet,” is the largest of three small bones in the middle ear. The malleus functions with the other bones to transmit vibrations from the eardrum to the inner ear. Conditions that affect the malleus often impact the ability to hear.  It sits in the middle ear between the incus and the eardrum. The parts of the malleus include the head, neck, and handle. A joint holds the head of the malleus and the incus together."} />
        <MuscularSystem 
        heading={"Incus:-"} 
        title={"The incus, also known as the “anvil,” is the middle of three small bones in the middle ear. The incus transmits vibrations from the malleus to the stapes. The vibrations then move to the inner ear. Conditions that affect the incus often affect the other ossicle bones."} />
        <MuscularSystem 
        heading={"Stapes :-"} 
        title={"The stapes is the third bone of the three ossicles in the middle ear. The stapes is a stirrup-shaped bone, and the smallest in the human body. The stapes is described as having a base, resting on the oval window, as well as a head that articulates with the incus, or anvil. The stapes is described as having a base, resting on the oval window, as well as a head that articulates with the incus, or anvil."} />
        <MuscularSystem 
        heading={"Chorda Tympani:-"} 
        title={"The chorda tympani is a nerve that arises from the mastoid segment of the facial nerve, carrying afferent special sensation from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue via the lingual nerve, as well as efferent parasympathetic secretomotor innervation to the submandibular and sublingual glands."} />
        <MuscularSystem 
        heading={"Greater Petrosal Nerve:-"} 
        title={"The greater petrosal nerve or superficial petrosal nerve is a branch of the nervus intermedius (nerve of Wrisberg) that carries parasympathetic, taste, and sensory fibers of the facial cranial nerve. The greater palatine nerve that innervates the bony hard palate of the mouth"} />

        heading={"Facial Nerve:-"} 
        title={"The facial nerve is the 7th cranial nerve and carries nerve fibers that control facial movement and expression. The facial nerve also carries nerves that are involved in taste to the anterior 2/3 of the tongue and producing tears (lacrimal gland)."} />

        heading={"Vestibulocochlear n.(CN VIII),Cochlear part:-"} 
        title={"The vestibulocochlear nerve, also known as cranial nerve eight (CN VIII), consists of the vestibular and cochlear nerves. Each nerve has distinct nuclei within the brainstem. CN VIII injuries are the result of pathological processes or injuries that commonly involve the cerebellopontine angle (CPA), the internal auditory canal (IAC), or the inner ear. In such cases, symptoms such as vertigo, nystagmus, tinnitus, and sensorineural hearing loss may occur."} />

        heading={"Vestibulocochlear n.(CN VIII),Vestibular part:-"} 
        title={"The vestibular nerve relays information related to motion and position. The vestibular system involves coordinated communication between the vestibular apparatus (semicircular canals, saccule, and utricle), ocular muscles, postural muscles, brainstem, and cerebral cortex."} />

        heading={"Superior Semicircular Canal:-"}

        <MuscularSystem 
        heading={" Posterior Semicircular Canal:-"} 
        title={"The posterior semicircular canal is a part of the vestibular system that detects rotation of the head around the antero-posterior (sagittal) axis, or in other words rotation in the coronal plane. This occurs, for example, when one moves the head to touch the shoulders, or when doing a cartwheel."} />
        <MuscularSystem 
        heading={"Lateral Semicircular Canal:-"} 
        title={"The lateral semicircular canal is about a 30-degree angle from the horizontal plane. The lateral canal detects angular acceleration of the head when the head is turned and the superior and posterior canals detect vertical head movements when the head is moved up or down."} />
        <MuscularSystem 
        heading={"Cochlea:-"} 
        title={"The cochlea contains the sensory organ of hearing. It bears a striking resemblance to the shell of a snail and in fact takes its name from the Greek word for this object. The cochlea is a spiral tube that is coiled two and one-half turns around a hollow central pillar, the modiolus."} />

        heading={"Eustachian Tube:-"} 
        title={"The Eustachian tube is a small passageway that connects your throat to your middle ear. When you sneeze, swallow, or yawn, your Eustachian tubes open. This keeps air pressure and fluid from building up inside your ear. But sometimes a Eustachian tube might get plugged. This is called Eustachian tube dysfunction. When this happens, sounds may be muffled, and your ear may feel full. You may also have ear pain."} />
