          "The trachea, also known as the windpipe, is a cartilaginous tube that connects the larynx to the bronchi of the lungs, allowing the passage of air, and so is present in almost all air-breathing animals with lungs. The trachea extends from the larynx and branches into the two primary bronchi."

        heading={"Alveoli:-"}
        title={
          "Alveoli are tiny air sacs in your lungs that take up the oxygen you breathe in and keep your body going. You have about 480 million alveoli, located at the end of bronchial tubes. When you breathe in, the alveoli expand to take in oxygen. When you breathe out, the alveoli shrink to expel carbon dioxide."

        heading={"Bronchus:-"}
        title={
          "The bronchi are the two large tubes that carry air from your windpipe to your lungs. You have a left and right main bronchus in each lung. After the main bronchi, these tubes branch out into segments that look like tree branches. Many respiratory conditions, such as asthma or bronchitis, can affect your bronchi."

        heading={"Bronchioles:-"}
        title={
          "Bronchioles are air passages inside the lungs that branch off like tree limbs from the bronchiâ€”the two main air passages into which air flows from the trachea (windpipe) after being inhaled through the nose or mouth. The bronchioles deliver air to tiny sacs called alveoli where oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged."

        title={
          "The diaphragm, located below the lungs, is the major muscle of respiration.It is a large, dome-shaped muscle that contracts rhythmically and continually, and most of the time, involuntarily. Upon inhalation, the diaphragm contracts and flattens and the chest cavity enlarges."

          "The left lung consists of two lobes and is longer and narrower than the right lung. The left lung has a concave region on the mediastinal surface called the cardiac notch that allows space for the heart. There is a cavity, called the pleural cavity, between the parietal and visceral layers of the pleura."
