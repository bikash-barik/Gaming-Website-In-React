Pulmonary veins differ from other veins in the body in that they transport deoxygenated blood back to the heart from the rest of the body. The left pulmonary veins bind to the left lung, and the lungs are made up of hollow air sacs known as alveoli. This is the process of removing oxygen from inhaled air.
